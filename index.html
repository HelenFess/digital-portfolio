       <p>Hello, my name is Helen Fessahaie, and I'm part of the Year Up program, which has been a phenomenal experience for me. </p>
       
       <p>I was previously working in corporate America in the sales department, which I truly loved.
         Apart from when Covid-19 hit, all our jobs we're not secured anymore.</p>

      <p>I saw my team losing their livelihood. I saw many of my peers being laid off, which did not resonate well with me.
         I've decided to research learning how to transition, and I realized I could join Year up to support me moving into a different career path.</p>

       <p> My dream job is to work as a software engineer and really be great at it it's just something that I've been interested in for a while and being able to apply these skills in my class on with my classmates has really shown me how it is rewarding task.
           I'm very excited to apply there's my internship and I'm looking forward to working with you and your team. </p>

           <p>I am very interested in the Software Engineer. 
                Please allow me to highlight my skills as they relate to the job opportunity. </p>
           
           <p>My track record of developing and streamlining processes to improve efficiency. 
                I had history of establishing and maintaining productive and 
                positive working relationships with clients to have come back to shop with us. 
                This was strategically placed in our lead profile so we can keep track of our returning clients.
                For example, clients can always keep in touch with me with personal contact and have personalized
                relations regarding business.

            a while alongside I am completing coursework relating to web development,
            network system admin, business communication while mainly focusing on quality assurance. </p>
